Real and digital worlds are uniting every day that effects production processes that will change dramatically in the future. Industry 4.0 is the title of the current trend of industrialization and knowledge transfer in production technologies. In Industry 4.0, it is essential to easily integrate new devices and sensors into the factory. These components from different manufacturers need to communicate in a common language by using a standardized communication protocol.  OPC Unified Architecture is one of the leading and preferred technology which is an industrial client-server machine to machine (M2M) communication model.  In this thesis, different performance tests of OPC UA applications in different embedded devices examined by using the open62541 framework.
